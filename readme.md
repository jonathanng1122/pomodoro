# Remain

Sounds like a game, this is a prodo app that measures the time you have left.

Trying out yarn in the client react folder

Note: If you need to change the pusher credentials, change 2 spots: './client/.env' and './config.js'


## for config.js
```
    pusherCredentials: {
        appId: "asdf",
        key: "asdf",
        secret: "asdf",
        cluster: "asdf",
        useTLS: true
    }

```

## for .env
PUSHER_KEY=pusherkeyhere
